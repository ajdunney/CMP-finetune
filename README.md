# Segformer on CMP Facade Dataset

This repository contains the implementation and results after finetuning  a Segformer model on the CMP Facade dataset, 
using the approach proposed in the paper [The devil is in the labels: Semantic segmentation from sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02002). 

The code builds on the repository and model provided by the authors [here](github.com/irfanICMLL/SSIW/tree/master)

The CMP Facade dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/).
